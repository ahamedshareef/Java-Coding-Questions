/*
 * some part of this is solved as part of 392 Leetcode where we find if there is a subseq or not.
 * 
 * Problem statement: we have to find min  window which has the sub seq for example:
 * s= "abc"; target = "adobecbadbc";
 * we have sub seq in 2 places 1st -> adobec where the starting and ending is 0 to 5 so the window lenght is 5
 * 2nd window adbc -> 7 to 10 where the window is 3 so the answer is (7,10) or return the window length as 3
