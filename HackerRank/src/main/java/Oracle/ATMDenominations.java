	 * Assume there are 100, 500, 1000 rupee denominations available in an ATM in limited number. 
	 * Write a program to dispense minimum number of notes 
	 * for each transaction and you are allowed to dispense maximum of 40 notes per transaction.
	 * Examples :

Input : [[100, 2], [500, 3], [1000, 4]], 4000
Output : 4

Input : [[100, 2], [500, 3], [1000, 5]], 10000
Output : "cannot dispense"

After completing the coding part he tested the code with some test cases and promoted me to third round which will start in another 10 mins.
